         <h3>About me</h3>
         They call me Mohit. A lot of people know me as a kind hearted person.
         I am fond of meeting new people and exploring new places.
         I am really passionate about travelling, making memories with unknown people and living life to the fullest.
         I love my family and sometimes it is very hard living here without them. 
         I am not fan of alcohol and drugs like a lot of people from my age are and I am proud about that. 
        </p>
